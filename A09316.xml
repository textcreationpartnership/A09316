            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:12219:4"/>
and for the contrary the louers ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of and abhorrors of vertuous exerciſe, vvere ſupreſſed. Your ſetting forth of vertue, and puniſhing of vice hath much moued mee to looke vppon my ſelf, and made me to forget that braine ſicke and that lewde rule of lyfe vvhich I haue ledde in the company of ſome of thoſe that vvil ſo play the gnatoes againſt me behinde my backe: and hath altogither moued me to this enterpriſe. I (though rude) haue not done it vppon any point of prody<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall preſumption, but moſt humblie haue I done it, bending my ſelfe with all humilitie to a bide the gentle correction of your grace, if in any thing I haue offe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded therby (vvhich my hope is I haue not) And although I bee poore, doe lacke the vvorldes goodes to lyue vvith all, and therefore doe novv and then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide the bitterneſſe of the croſſe of pouertie, yet what then, it hath not made me a clavv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>backe of heritickes.

<pb facs="tcp:12219:4"/>
it vvas vvell vvorthie to be receiued, and ſo it vvas of a certaine of the chiefeſt of them, and I co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tented thervvith: but yet there vvere ſome, that vvhen I vvas ſo readie to deliuer it, they vvere as ſlovv to receiue it, and had as little leyſor as thoſe vvhich are ſpoken of by Chriſt in the xiiij.

The vvhich hath not made me to think to gaine any vvorldly liuing to enrich my ſelfe heere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, neither haue I done it to pleaſe heritikes vvith all, nor yet doe I think that my profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion herein is heriſie: for vvhy I am ſure that heritikes vvill be angrie vvith me for it: And as for the booke I vvill iuſtifie it vvith and againſt all Baalits, that vvill any vvay backe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bite me therefore) to be true and perfect re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion (vnder your graces correction) accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the truth &amp; true meaning of Chriſt our head. And as for the name of a proteſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t (though not a pratling proteſtant) I am very glad to beare it at theyr hands: for in deed, I do proteſt &amp; before god do vtterly aba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>do<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; forſake the diuil and all his vvorks as I haue profeſſed in my baptiſme: and alſo I do pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt, forſake, and (by the helpe of God) for euer doe renou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce Antichriſt &amp; all his mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers vvith all their diuiliſh doctrine and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſions:

            <p>It may be, novv that I haue made this an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere, to theſe and ſuch lyke good fellowes as I haue before ſpoken off: that they vvill aſſalt me a freſhe and ſaye, that I haue ſpent this trauayle for an other purpoſe, and that is, bycauſe I would ſhewe my ſkill, and ſo

finde falte with mee, for that I haue vſed no more eloquence. But yet they are deceyued, I haue not done it to any ſuch ende, bicauſe I haue it not. I want the eloque<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of Tullie,<note place="margin">A God of the Poets fayning.</note> and the helpe of Mercurie the God of that Arte: And againe wee neede none of them not their helps herein, for that a profeſſor of diuinity ought to ſpeak properly &amp; not elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently. And alſo it is not ſkil but good will that bringeth men vnto God. And therefore they that ſhal ſay, that I haue don it for any of thoſe cauſes doe mee great wrong. I haue don it for three other cauſes, which is to ſay, for pollicy, loue, &amp; hope: for policy, bicauſe I haue ſeen proued by experie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, that he which is a weak Soldier, ſpeedeth beſt vnder the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feign or ba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ner of the beſt, ſtro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>geſt, &amp; valyan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt Captaine: I thought it good to play the lyke part, and ſo to ſhroud my ſelf vnder the banner of your Graces protection, thynkyng thereby to be ſufficiently armed at proofe, to defende my ſelfe from the worſt that eyther Zoylus, Momus, or Baalit,<note place="margin">Rom. 12.13. 1.

For loue, bycauſe of the exhortations that the Apoſtles Paule, Peter, &amp; Iohn, haue in diuers places of theyr Epiſtles, incited me vnto: S.

I haue none other riches, wherfore I thought it good to beſtow and diſtribute this amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g my bretheren, tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting they wil take it in good part. For hope, bicauſe I am perſvvaded that your grace vvil ſo vvell like of the booke, that my hope is I ſhall be greatly incouraged, ſo vvell to ſpend time heereafter, that in all godly doinges I ſhal reape the commoditie of ſo godly a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron.

His ioye is ſuch for our ſaluacion then, that the accompt which he hath of our offences,<note place="margin">Ezech. 18 &amp;. 28.</note> is as if we had neuer offended.

               <p>It is a bitter torment of mynde &amp; chriſtian conſcience, to conſider how many are made affraide, diſcouraged and driuen to doubte, by our denega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion or deniall of our Chriſt. (For al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they were tender younglings in the knowledge of him at the firſt) now condempninge (through vs) the trueth which before they did allowe. This will wounde our weake conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>derfully which doo ſo reuolt. And therefore (I meane, to the ende we ſhould doo ſo) doothe ſathan make ſuch continual warre againſt vs. But therin (to ſuch lyke reuolters) it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peneth as it did to the Apoſtles which dyd deny their maiſter, and made ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny to faint, feare, and doubt (in and) of him. But although as weake &amp; vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trained ſouldiers to ſuch lyke warres we be often put to ſcilence and made to breake aray by our enimies. Yet it is very conuenient &amp; fit that we ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a new force vnto vs, and once a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine to confeſſe the trueth ſtoutely which we haue ſtaggered, falle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> from,

               <p>Although before they had denyed it, yet they conuerted and dyd returne agayne to réedifie by their dealinges that which they hadde diſtroyed (in ſéekynge mortall lyfe) by denegati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of theyr maiſter. If with weake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe wée doe commit this as they dyd, we haue the like vertue, and as full power to repent, pray to God and conuert as they had.</p>
               <p>And therefore the holy Ghoſt ſaithe, (and dooth commaunde vs by Sainct Paule,<note place="margin">Hebr. 5. &amp; &amp;. 1.2.3</note>) wée haue not a highe prieſt that can not take compaſſion of our infirmyties, but we haue ſuche a one as was tempted in all thinges lyke vnto vs: and yet without ſinne.</p>
               <p>Let vs go therefore boldlye vntoo and béefore the throne of that good highe Prieſt,<note place="margin">Hebr. 4. &amp; 16.</note> that wée may receyue mercy and fynde grace to helpe vs in tyme of néede.</p>

               <p>And ſith that onely in God (who is the fountayne of all goodneſſe) there is mercy, let vs not thincke to fynde it in any other but onely in him, in thoſe that haue his ſpirit,<note place="margin">The condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion of the mercy of God.</note> and be membres of Chriſt his ſonne.

Wherefore thoſe two things be ſo vnyted and knit togither, that the one is comprehended within the other, for that in ſuffering with Chriſt, and to be made lyke vnto him, is comprehended the ioyntely beyng glorified with him.

               <p>Remember the wordes which I haue ſayde vnto you, the ſeruaunt is not greater then his Lorde, if they haue perſecuted mée they will alſo perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute you.
